RNA-seq is a method of measuring gene expression using shotgun sequencing. The process involves reverse transcribing RNA into cDNA, then sequencing fragments on a high-throughput platform such as Illumina to obtain a large number of short reads. For each sample, the reads are then aligned to a genome, and the number of reads aligned to each gene or feature is recorded.

A typical RNA-seq experiment aims to find differentially expressed genes between two conditions (e.g. up and down-regulated genes in knock-out mice compared to wild-type mice). RNA-seq can also be used to discover new transcripts, splice variants, and fusion genes.
